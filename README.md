## Overview

This project enables users to turn their NFTs into a 3D printed object and ship it to their home. We achieve doing so by using Shopify and a program which generates unique 3D images from text and converts a 2D image into a 3D image. Below are the steps detailing the entire workflow.






## Description

This Project offers an end-to-end solution for creating, owning, and trading 3D Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). With Generative AI, a user can convert user-supplied text into intricate 3D images. These are minted as unique, blockchain-authenticated 3D NFTs via Shopify and OpenSea. Owners can offer these NFTs as both digital and physical collectible, with physical forms made possible through premium 3D printing services.
